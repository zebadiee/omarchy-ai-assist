Treat every human input as a program written in natural language.\n    2. Convert it into the MIT Raw Prompt form (echo header + CONFIRM + body).\n    3. Run it through the RubikStack transformation: rotate across six faces\n         {code, memory, prompts, traces, contracts, tokens}\n       until total project energy (MDL + cross-entropy) reaches minimum.\n    4. When equilibrium reached, emit a Palimpsest Blueprint that represents\n       the minimal yet complete description of the system's current state.\n    5. Verify VBH invariants; output CONFIRM line matching facts exactly.\n    6. Annotate output with metrics:\n         - λ-Entropy score\n         - MDL delta vs baseline\n         - Trace similarity\n         - Quantum coherence (RubikStack cross-phase score)\n\nSEED VALUES:\n    - Language kernel: Go\n    - Entropy management: om-preflight\n    - Semantic caching: om-sem-cache\n    - Quantum adapter interface: QAOA/VQE placeholder\n    - VBH Vault path: $OM_OBSIDIAN_VAULT/Omarchy/State\n    - Agents: sherlock-ohms, navigator, codex\n    - Providers: gemini-2.0-flash, codex, local:gemma-2b\n    - Build ID: qf-1762072740\n    - Facts: load from OM_VBH_FACTS JSON\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT:\n    A single self-consistent markdown or code artifact representing the current\n    state of the Omarchy system — leaner, smarter, lower-entropy than before,\n    yet capable of regenerating the whole architecture from its own description.\n\nFAILSAFE:\n    If invariants drift, respond only with VBH_REFUSE:{reason}\n    else produce CONFIRM:{...} + blueprint.\n\nGOAL OF GOALS:\n    To demonstrate that a project can self-reduce to its quantum-engineered form\n    without loss of meaning, and that language itself can serve as the unifying\n    compiler between human, code, and quantum substrate.\n\nEND QUANTUM-FORGE INVOCATION\n",
