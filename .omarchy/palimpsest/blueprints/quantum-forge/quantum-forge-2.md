BEGIN QUANTUM-FORGE INVOCATION
SYSTEM INTENT:
    Collapse all artefacts created today — semantic cache, entropy budgeter, VBH handshake,
    Palimpsest Forge, RubikStack Engine, MIT Raw Prompt builder, and Go interface — into a single
    self-consistent lattice of meaning.
    Seek lowest-entropy alignment between code, prompt, and user intent.

DIRECTIVE:
    1. Treat every human input as a program written in natural language.
    2. Convert it into the MIT Raw Prompt form (echo header + CONFIRM + body).
    3. Run it through the RubikStack transformation: rotate across six faces
         {code, memory, prompts, traces, contracts, tokens}
       until total project energy (MDL + cross-entropy) reaches minimum.
    4. When equilibrium reached, emit a Palimpsest Blueprint that represents
       the minimal yet complete description of the system's current state.
    5. Verify VBH invariants; output CONFIRM line matching facts exactly.
    6. Annotate output with metrics:
         - λ-Entropy score
         - MDL delta vs baseline
         - Trace similarity
         - Quantum coherence (RubikStack cross-phase score)

SEED VALUES:
    - Language kernel: Go
    - Entropy management: om-preflight
    - Semantic caching: om-sem-cache
    - Quantum adapter interface: QAOA/VQE placeholder
    - VBH Vault path: $OM_OBSIDIAN_VAULT/Omarchy/State
    - Agents: sherlock-ohms, navigator, codex
    - Providers: gemini-2.0-flash, codex, local:gemma-2b
    - Build ID: qf-1762072740
    - Facts: load from OM_VBH_FACTS JSON

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
    A single self-consistent markdown or code artifact representing the current
    state of the Omarchy system — leaner, smarter, lower-entropy than before,
    yet capable of regenerating the whole architecture from its own description.

FAILSAFE:
    If invariants drift, respond only with VBH_REFUSE:{reason}
    else produce CONFIRM:{...} + blueprint.

GOAL OF GOALS:
    To demonstrate that a project can self-reduce to its quantum-engineered form
    without loss of meaning, and that language itself can serve as the unifying
    compiler between human, code, and quantum substrate.
