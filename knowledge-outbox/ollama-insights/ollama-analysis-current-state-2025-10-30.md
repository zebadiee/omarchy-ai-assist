## Analysis Results

1. Key Insights about Team Collaboration Patterns:
   - The Omarchy AI team has been active with three assistants currently engaged, out of a total of five, indicating that the team is utilizing its resources effectively but could potentially benefit from greater involvement of all members.
   - The last recorded collaboration was on October 29th, 2025, suggesting a need for more frequent communication and knowledge sharing to maintain a cohesive team environment.

2. Performance Observations:
   - There are 14 knowledge entries, which show the team's focus on building a solid foundation of shared knowledge. However, there are only two pending tasks, indicating that the workload might be unevenly distributed or that the team is not fully utilizing its capabilities.
