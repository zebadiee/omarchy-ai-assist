# 🎓 Lesson 0: Speccy Self-Optimization - READY FOR EXECUTION

## 🚀 Immediate Launch Commands

The AI Training Lab is now operational. You can run Lesson 0 immediately:

```bash
# Method 1: Direct lesson execution
./speccy lesson self-optimize

# Method 2: Workflow integration (includes memory and reflection)
./speccy workflow ai_self_optimize

# Method 3: Check available lessons
./speccy lesson
```

## 📋 What Lesson 0 Will Do

**Stage 1 - OBSERVE**:

- Run validation workflow to establish baseline
- Run lint/test workflow to measure current performance
- Count existing log files for pattern analysis

**Stage 2 - ANALYSE**:

- Parse workflow logs for success patterns
- Count repetitive command sequences
- Search for timing bottlenecks
- Run reflection on findings

**Stage 3 - PROPOSE**:

- Generate 4 specific optimization proposals
- Store proposals in `speccy-lab/logs/proposals.log`
- Create improvement ideas tracking

**Stage 4 - SIMULATE**:

- Dry-run optimized workflows safely
- Test memory system performance
- Validate sandbox boundaries

**Stage 5 - REPORT**:

- Generate completion report
- Store milestone in memory
- Final reflection on learnings

## 🛡️ Safety Features Active

- ✅ SafeOps guardrails enforced
- ✅ Sandbox boundaries validated
- ✅ DRY=1 for all simulations
- ✅ No modifications outside speccy-lab/
- ✅ Complete audit trail in memory

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

- Memory entries: ~8-10 learning entries
- Log files: 4 new analysis logs in `speccy-lab/logs/`
- Insights: Optimization proposals and bottleneck analysis
- Milestone: Lesson 0 completion certificate
